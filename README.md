## About BigQuery Toolbox
The BigQuery Toolbox is a lightweight Chrome browser extension made for users of Google BigQuery. The BigQuery Toolbox comes with a set of features designed to make your live in BigQuery a lot easier. Top features include:

* Toggle the "Explorer" side panel with the click of a button
* Toggle the "Query Results" with the click of a button
* Show (smaller, redesigned) query tabs in multiple rows.
* Hide the top toolbar ("Features & Info" / "Shortcut" / "Disable Editor Tabs")
* Minimize the "Compose new query" button

## How to install
Simply install from the Chrome Web Store at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bigquery-toolbox/gogipkdhiiopcbfakdagfkinjoecfoam.

## Pin to toolbar
After installing what you want to do first is to "pin" the BigQuery Toolbox icon to your extension toolbar in Chrome for easier access.

To do that, click the "Extensions" button in the top-right of your browser, next to your profile picture (the button that looks like a puzzle piece). From the dropdown list, find "BigQuery Toolbox" and click the pin so it turns blue. Boom.

## How to use
While in BigQuery, simply click the BigQuery Toolbox button to toggle the Explorer column. 

## Advanced Configuration
For more advances features, right-click the extension icon and click on "Options".

Here you can do two things.

First, you can set what left-clicking the extension button does. By default it just toggles the Explorer column. If you tick "Hide Query Results", it will also hide the query results every time you click the icon.

Second, you can further improve the BigQuery UI by checking the following options

- Hide Top Toolbar: This hides the rather useless top toolbar that says "Features & Info".
- Minimize the 'Create New Query' button: Removes the "Create new query" from the button and just leaves the large "[+]" icon
- Redesigned multi-row query tabs: Instead of having a side-scrolling query tab bar, enabling this feature shows tabs in multiple rows, while also reducing their size
